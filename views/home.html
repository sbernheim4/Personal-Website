				<p>I am currently attending Brandeis University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. My prefered languages are Java and Python but I'm also very familiar with Javascript and Scheme. I focus on full-stack web development primarily with the MEAN Stack. However I have also used the ReactJS framework and love exploring new frameworks.</p>
				<p>At Brandeis my courses have ranged from traditional Data Structures and Algorithms to functional programming classes writing simplfied compilers and evaluators as well as Theory of Computation.</p>
				<p>Last summer I worked for MLB Advanced Media as a Front End Developer on their Sponsorship, and Web Platform teams. I was responsible for building up pages for sponsors and working on a custom interactive page for their AWS servers.
				<p>Additionally, I worked at OMB Labs where I was responsible for writing the WayWay API, designing their two websites using Strikingly, and for conducting research on potential clients.</p>
				<p>My biggest personal project has been creating website for Kinetic Global, an action oriented think tank with chapters at many different colleges and universites.</p>
